## Prerequisites

Before starting, please ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.

1. **Check Node.js version**: You need Node.js installed (v12 or higher is recommended). You can check the installed version by running the following command:

   ```bash
   node -v
   ```

2. **Check npm version**: You also need npm to install the required dependencies. Check the installed version of npm by running:
   ```bash
   npm -v
   ```

If Node.js or npm is not installed, the tests may not run as expected.

## Installation

Once you have verified Node.js and npm are installed, follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arashn2y/todo-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd todo-app
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Learn More
